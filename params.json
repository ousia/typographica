  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nIn this page, I would like to offer some thoughts on font families and probably some free fonts.\r\n\r\nMy background isn’t graphical design, but digital editing texts. I love book typesetting. I don’t have a printing press, but a computer. [ConTeXt](http://contextgarden.net) and [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org) are the main tools I use. A sample of what can be done with them is located at <http://www.from-pandoc-to-context.tk>. You may have a taste of [its documentation](https://github.com/ousia/from-pandoc-to-context/tree/master/doc).\r\n\r\nAs life itself, this page will always be work in progress. I hope to update it frequently, but only time will tell.\r\n\r\n### Why am I offering font versions?\r\n\r\nAs I wrote before, I’m not a designer. Even less, I’m not a font desginer.\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, I wouldn’t be doing this, since it would be meaningless. But let’s face it, even technology is far from being perfect.\r\n\r\nAt least the first typeface I would like to offer is the adaptation of an existing one (_Tempora_) to be used within an e–ink reader. At least the one I use (Sony PRS-T1) doesn’t support OpenType features. As an example, the way of having small caps in ePub documents for all e–ink readers is having a different font embedded in the document itself.\r\n\r\nSo this fonts are adaptations to be used in scenarios where no better alternative is suited. One of these scenarios is an e--ink reader with ePub documents. I need to select the least common denominator to provide a minimally pleasing reading of texts in ePub format.\r\n\r\n### Fonts and Typefaces\r\n\r\nFonts differ from typefaces. Roman (or upright), italics, bold and bold italics are four fonts. They may be part of the same typeface, if they belong to the same font family.\r\n\r\n_Palatino_ has four fonts (regular, italics, bold and bold italics), but it constitutes a single typeface or font family. _Times New Roman_ italics and _Garamond_ bold are two different fonts, which also belong to two different typefaces.\r\n\r\n## Personal Interests\r\n\r\nThere are some personal interests\r\n\r\nbook composition, not design\r\n\r\ne--readers\r\n\r\nancient Greek\r\n\r\nnot cheap fonts\r\n\r\n## _Times_\r\n\r\nI must confess that I had hated this typeface in the past. Being the default for _Microsoft Word_, _Times New Roman_ was overexposed.\r\n\r\n_Times_ is one of those few intemporal typefaces. Its main feature is readability. But it wasn’t designed for computers, but for a paper. Namely, for _The Times_.\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n## _Palatino_\r\n\r\n## _Garamond_\r\n\r\n## The Greek Font Society\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\nIf you want to comment anything about this project, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ousia/typographica/issues/new).",
