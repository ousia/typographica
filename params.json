I love book typesetting. I don’t have a printing press, but a computer. [ConTeXt](http://contextgarden.net) and [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org) are the main tools I use. A sample of what can be done with them is located at <http://www.from-pandoc-to-context.tk>.\r\n\r\nAs life itself, this page will always be work in progress. I hope to update it frequently, but only time will tell.",
