## Introduction

In this page, I would like to offer some thoughts on font families and probably some free fonts.

My background isn’t graphical design, but digital editing texts. I love book typesetting. I don’t have a printing press, but a computer. [ConTeXt](http://contextgarden.net) and [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org) are the main tools [I use](http://from-pandoc-to-context.tk).

As life itself, this page will always be work in progress. I hope to update it frequently, but time will tell.

### Why am I offering versions?

As I wrote before, I’m not a designer. Even less, I’m not a font desginer.

In a perfect world, I wouldn’t be doing this, since it would be meaningless. But let’s face it, even technology is far from being perfect.

At least the first typeface I would like to offer is the adaptation of an existing one (_Tempora_) to be used within an e–reader. At least the one I use (Sony PRS-T1) doesn’t support OpenType features. As an example, the way of having small caps in ePub documents for all e–readers is having a different font embedded in the document itself.
