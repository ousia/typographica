## Introduction

In this page, I would like to offer some thoughts on font families and probably some free fonts.

My background isn’t graphical design, but digital editing texts. I love book typesetting. I don’t have a printing press, but a computer. [ConTeXt](http://contextgarden.net) and [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org) are the main tools I use. A sample of what can be done with them is located at <http://www.from-pandoc-to-context.tk>.

As life itself, this page will always be work in progress. I hope to update it frequently, but only time will tell.

### Why am I offering font versions?

As I wrote before, I’m not a designer. Even less, I’m not a font desginer.

In a perfect world, I wouldn’t be doing this, since it would be meaningless. But let’s face it, even technology is far from being perfect.

At least the first typeface I would like to offer is the adaptation of an existing one (_Tempora_) to be used within an e–reader. At least the one I use (Sony PRS-T1) doesn’t support OpenType features. As an example, the way of having small caps in ePub documents for all e–readers is having a different font embedded in the document itself.

### Fonts and Typefaces

Fonts differ from typefaces. Roman (or upright), italics, bold and bold italics are four fonts. They may be part of the same typeface, if they belong to the same font family.

_Palatino_ has four fonts (regular, italics, bold and bold italics), but it constitutes a single typeface or font family. _Times New Roman_ italics and _Garamond_ bold are two different fonts, which also belong to two different typefaces.

## _Times_

I must confess that I had hated this typeface in the past. Being the default for _Microsoft Word_

## _Palatino_

## _Garamond_

## The Greek Font Society
